            The problem that this test contains is an actual challenge that we
            faced during the development of our custom account area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main focus is on data manipulation and presenting order history
            information to a customer by bundling the products from an API call
            in a structured and more readable way. In the Order History view
            there is a component with some hardcoded HTML that needs to be
            transformed into a React component that is fetching the data the API
            endpoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to make the component look as close as possible to the
            hardcoded version of it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Here is the endpoint to pull the information from:{' '}
